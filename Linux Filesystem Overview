The Linux filesystem hierarchy consists of several standard directories, each serving a specific purpose. Below is an overview of some key directories.

## 1. `/bin` - Essential User Binaries
**Description**: Contains essential binaries (programs) that are required for the system to boot and run in single-user mode. These are basic commands accessible to all users.

**Examples of Contents**:
```bash
/bin/ls
/bin/cp
/bin/mkdir
```

---

## 2. `/sbin` - System Binaries
**Description**: Contains essential binaries for system administration tasks, such as managing services and hardware. These are typically restricted to the root user.

**Examples of Contents**:
```bash
/sbin/reboot
/sbin/fsck
/sbin/ifconfig
```

---

## 3. `/var` - Variable Files
**Description**: Stores variable files such as logs, spool files (for mail or print queues), and temporary files that change during system operation.

**Examples of Contents**:
```bash
/var/log          # System logs
/var/spool        # Print or mail queue
/var/cache        # Application cache files
```

---

## 4. `/tmp` - Temporary Files
**Description**: A directory for temporary files created by programs during execution. Files in `/tmp` are typically cleared on reboot.

**Examples of Contents**:
```bash
/tmp/session123.tmp
/tmp/logs.tmp
```

---

## 5. `/dev` - Device Files
**Description**: Contains device files that represent hardware devices such as disks, terminals, and printers. These files act as interfaces to the system's hardware.

**Examples of Contents**:
```bash
/dev/sda1         # First hard disk partition
/dev/tty0         # Terminal
/dev/null         # Null device
```

---

## 6. `/etc` - Configuration Files
**Description**: Contains configuration files for the system and installed applications. These files are typically in plain text format and editable by the root user.

**Examples of Contents**:
```bash
/etc/passwd       # User account information
/etc/fstab        # Filesystem table
/etc/ssh/sshd_config  # SSH server configuration
```

---

## 7. `/mnt` - Mount Points
**Description**: A directory where temporary filesystems or external storage devices (e.g., USB drives) can be mounted.

**Examples of Usage**:
```bash
# Mount a USB drive
mount /dev/sdb1 /mnt
```

## 8. `/media` - Removable Media
**Description**: Contains subdirectories for mounting removable media such as USB drives, CDs, and DVDs.
